# Overview

This software is a minecraft mod that I developed based of the basic structure and libraries provided for others to do the same. Specifically this mod creates a new item in the game: the coin. This coin can be held and when used, will be removed from the inventory and increase a wealth value attached to the player. This value lasts through different play sessions.

The purpose of me writing this software was primarily to get me familiar and personally acquainted with the java language, but also was something that I have wanted to do for a long time.
The biggest thing that I learned about the syntax of Java was how similar it was to C#. But beyond that, it's a language that is well compartmentalized and is straightforward in its syntax.

# Development Environment

To develop this mod, I used IntelliJ community edition. It was stated that minecraft modding is explicitly supported by eclipse, but I have personally been recommended IntelliJ and I have not been disappointed. 

I used Java and the Minecraft forge libraries that are necessary for this development.
